# Learning to commit

When you have your changes you'd like to make. You can stage them for commit 
```sh
git add <files> 
# Or if you want to add any changes in the current directory
git add . 
```

Once you have staged them to be committed you can commit it
```sh
git commit -m "insert your commit message here"
```

Once you have committed you can ship it 
```sh
git push 
```

# Troubleshooting
You can use the following to see the status of changes
```sh
git status
```
